    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Zurich's
      [Center for Reproducible Science (CRS)](http://www.crs.uzh.ch) and the
      [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/de/aboutus/departments/biostatistics.html)

      My main activities are courses in good research practice across faculties,
      teaching of statistics to students in biostatistics and medicine, and two meta-research projects:
      the first about publication bias in medicine and the second about post-publication statistical review
      of research results.

      I have a broad set of methodological expertise in psychiatry research, for example, in the analysis of neuroimaging data,
      the development of methods for brain connectivity, and statistical support in the planning and analysis different types of studies, for example randomized controlled trials, diagnostic test, etc.
